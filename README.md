# Credit-Risk-Data-Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes credit risk data to predict the likelihood of loan defaults. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning modeling.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
  
## Key Finding
- Loans are predominantly sought for secondary education, followed by higher education. However, the default rate among borrowers with secondary education is substantially higher than those with higher education credentials. This points to education level as a significant determinant of loan repayment capacity.
- Pensioners show a lower default rate, implying that despite a potentially fixed or lower income, they maintain a higher reliability in repaying loans.
- Although loans are less frequently taken by males, the data indicates that the proportion of male defaulters is notably higher compared to females. This suggests gender as a potential factor in assessing loan risk.
- Married individuals are the most common applicants for loans and tend to have lower default rates. In contrast, singles and those in civil marriages exhibit higher default rates, highlighting the influence of marital status on loan repayment behavior.
- Laborers and various staff categories are the most frequent loan applicants, yet managers and high-skilled tech staff prove to be the most reliable in terms of repayment. This underscores the role of occupation type in predicting loan default risk.

- People tend to make more loan for 'Secondary special' and their loan is also approved.
- Married people are more likely to pay back their loans on time compared to single people, as indicated by the differences in loan approval statuses.
- People tend to make more loan for 'Working' and their loan is also approved.
- People tend to make more loan for 'Secondary special','Sales Staff' and their loan is also approved.
- There's a distinct variation among the approval statuses ("Approved, Refused, Unused, and Cancelled") concerning the "House/apartment" category.
- This column appears to be the most significant. Individuals associated with "Business Entity Type 3" and those who are self-employed tend to have the highest default rates.
